Heart Disease Prediction Model Using ML and Logistic Regression

The Heart Disease Prediction Model leverages machine learning and logistic regression to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals. Here’s a concise overview:
* Purpose
To accurately forecast the probability of a person having heart disease based on various health parameters.

*  Methodology
1. *Data Collection*: Gather health data such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc.
2. *Data Preprocessing*: Clean, normalize, and encode the data for consistency and efficiency.
3. *Feature Selection*: Identify key features that strongly correlate with heart disease.
4. *Model Training*: Use logistic regression to train the model on the training dataset.
5. *Model Evaluation*: Assess the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
6. *Prediction*: Classify new data as 'at risk' or 'not at risk' for heart disease.



* Applications
Used in healthcare settings to assist in early diagnosis and preventive measures for heart disease.

This model provides a reliable and interpretable way to predict heart disease, aiding in timely medical interventions.
